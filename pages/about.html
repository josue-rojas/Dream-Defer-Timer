        This page does not represent anything. And by anything I mean this page is meant for people who have DACA and wish to post it, but we do not check if they actually have DACA or the expiration. <strong>Anyone can submit a new post.</strong>

        This was build using <a href='https://pages.github.com'>Github Pages</a>. By doing this I limit myself to static pages and making them dynamic by changing content using JavaScript. Easy peasy. The point of using github for hosting is cause it's free. But it has some limits. If some things are slow or seem slow this might explain some things.

      <div class='text'>
        If there are any bugs, issues, concerns, or upgrades send them to guy.montag.sr+dd@gmail.com If its an issue or bug write a description of how it happen and what happens. If it is an upgrade tell me in detail what it is. I also appreciate design upgrades, even better if you send me a picture.
