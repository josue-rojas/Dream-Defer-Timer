        This website is inspired by those instagram post of 'Dreamers' who have been posting their days left with Defered Action (DACA). I believe it is more impactful to see timers ticking down to show how important and sensitive this issue is. Every timer as it ends becomes (an) impediment/struggle/obstacle for an American to achieve their full potential. (It does not mean we can't achieve this potential). This is just to bring awareness to other Americans.

        But of course this is my opinion (I am not part of any group just a person who decided to make this website to show my support using what I know what to do).

        This website may not represent factual information. <strong>Anyone can submit a new timer</strong> and I do not check for valid information. Also I do not collect any information other than a name (which can be anything), end date for your DACA (used to get timers), instagram (this is optional), and favorite color used for styling. After timers expires it gets deleted. Again <strong>anyone can submit a new timer</strong> so any data can be made up as far as I know.

        If there are any bugs, issues, concerns, or upgrades send them to guy.montag.sr+dd@gmail.com If its an issue or bug write a description of how it happen and what happens. If it is an upgrade tell me in detail what it is. I also appreciate design upgrades, even better if you send me a picture.

      <div class='title'>Technical (boring stuff)</div>
      <div class='text'>
        This was build using <a href='https://pages.github.com'>Github Pages</a>. Mainly because it is free to host. The database is not directly connected since it goes to sleep without inactivity. This would slow down the site when loading the information. To get around this I update the information everyday (I have script so its automated). The only downside is that the page has be rendered through javascript to make it dynamic. Anywway this may explain some things, for example sometimes submiting a new timer is slow cause it is waiting for the other server to wake up. But that is boring stuff I just put this bit for anyone who might be interested.
